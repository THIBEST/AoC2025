# Advent of Code 2025

Welcome to the Advent of Code 2025! This repository contains my solutions to the challenges presented throughout the event. Advent of Code is an annual online event where participants are given a series of programming puzzles to solve every day from December 1st until December 12th (used to be until the 25th, but it changed this year).

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is created by Eric Wastl and is designed to present two new coding challenges each day leading up to Christmas. The puzzles cover a variety of topics and are meant to challenge and entertain programmers of all skill levels.

## Structure of this Repository

The src folder contains the source code (ts) for each day's challenge. Each file is named dayX - challengeName.ts where X is the day number, and challengeName is the name of the challenge.
